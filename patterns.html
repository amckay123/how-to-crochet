            <h1>---> PATTERNS <---</h1>
            Now that you have your supplies and skills at the ready, it's time to put them into action!
            There are many websites you can go to to see patterns, such as <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/account/login" target="_blank">Ravelry</a>,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://www.etsy.com" target="_blank">Etsy</a>.

            <h1>GOOD WEBSITES</h1>
            There's lots of websites on the internet. Are all of them good? No. Viruses, trackers, etc are now a common thing. You can't necessarily avoid them,
            but you can at least try to be careful. Don't click any ads, ignore AI, and look for websites that are well known and generally look 
            professional (ex. a website you've never heard of called FreeCoolCrochetPatterns1000001.com, more like FreeCool<u><b>DataStealers</b></u>1000001.com!!!).

        <div class="right">
            <h1>LANGUAGE AND ABBREVIATIONS</h1>
            At this point, you should have your pattern and chosen supplies. Now it's time to read and follow this pattern. Usually there's an answer key at 
            the start of each pattern, but here's a chart to help you memorize. Most patterns are written in the US style (slightly different from the UK style),
            but most patterns specify which one they use at the start.
