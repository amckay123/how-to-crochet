            The crafting stores and textile isles of Walmart can be extremely intimidating.
             In this section, you will learn how to brace the wilds of the expansive craft areas, and navigate to your chosen supplies.
             <br><br>
             Be brave, viewer, for the shelves of you local craft store are not to be taken lightly.

            <h1>KEEP IN MIND!</h1>
            If you have any allergies or sensitivities, make sure to <b>read the labels</b> on what you're planning to buy.
            <br><br>
            Don't forget to <b>do your research!</b> If you HATE plastic and its effects on the environment, maybe don't buy
            plastic yarn or tools. Buy something natural like cotton or bamboo (yes, bamboo is used to make yarn and hooks).

            <h1>WHAT TO BUY</h1>
            "AHHHH!!! What the HECK do I buy?!?! The Wallmart yarn isle is SO SCARY!"
            <br><br>
            Fear not, dear viewer, for this section is an <i><b>ALL-IN-ONE PURCHASE GUIDE!!!</b></i>
            From yarn to hooks to weird stuff nobody ever uses, you've got a guide to it all RIGHT HERE!
            <br><br>
            The first thing you want to do is brainstorm an idea for something to make. Pick something not too complicated, like
             an animal or cup cozy. My very first project was a tiny jellyfish. Save the sweaters and blankets for later, when you know your stuff. 
            <br><br>
            Once you pick out a pattern or YouTube tutorial (lucky for you, there's a page <a href="patterns.html" target="_blank">right here</a> for that), it's now time to choose your yarn. Look for something that catches your eye. For a beginner,
             I recommend something not too dark, not too thin, and not fluffy. Cotton or polyester should be your goal. If you are making an animal, you could 
             buy buttons, needles, and thread to sew for the eyes. If you want to buy those plastic safety eyes, thats good too. It's all about personal preference. Don't
             forget to buy a pack of <u>stitch markers</u> for later use. They are a common tool in <b>almost every</b> crochet pattern. DON'T BUY ANYTHING YOU DON'T NEED!
             "But website, this ______ looks so cool! My credit card is calling me....." 
            <b>NO!!!</b> For now, avoid emptying your wallet and only buy <b>essential</b> tools.
            <br><br>
            Now it's time to pick out a hook. Look at the label on your ball of yarn and find the hook symbol. There are some different types of hooks you can choose from, like
            metal, plastic, wood, and ergonomic.
            <br><br>
            In this specific picture, inside the red circle, you can see the reccommended hook size is 6.5mm.
