            <h1>AI? GOODBYE!</h1>
            Unfortunately, many people fall for AI. It's important to support REAL PEOPLE and not someones one sentence 
            picture generator. AI destroys the whole point of art and crushes the hopes and dreams of all artists everywhere. 
            DON'T SUPPORT AI!!
            <br><br>
            Looking for AI is not something I can really teach you, other than if it looks too beautiful, it's probably a scam.
            You'll get to a point where you can identify AI with a single glance with time.
